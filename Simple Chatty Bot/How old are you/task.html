<p>At this stage, you will introduce yourself to the bot. He will greet you by your name and then try to guess your age
    using arithmetic operations.</p>

<p>Your program must print the following lines:</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2018.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {yourName}!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
Your age is {yourAge}; that's a good time to start programming!</code></pre>

<p>You may change the name and the creation year of your bot if you want.</p>

<p>Instead of <code class="language-xml">{yourName}</code>, the bot must print your name entered from the standard
    input. Instead of <code class="language-xml">{yourAge}</code>, the bot must determine your age according to the
    following formula:</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">age = (remainder3 * 70 + remainder5 * 21 + remainder7 * 15) % 105</code></pre>

<p>Where <code class="language-xml">remainder3</code>, <code class="language-xml">remainder5</code> and <code
        class="language-xml">remainder7</code> is three numbers you input to the program.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a dialogue with the bot. Input lines are started with "&gt;" symbol. You do not need to read
    this symbol.</p>

<pre><code class="language-xml">Hello! My name is Aid.
I was created in 2018.
Please, remind me your name.
&gt; Max
What a great name you have, Max!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
&gt; 1 2 1
Your age is 22; that's a good time to start programming!</code></pre>
