<p>A detector compares the size of parts produced by a machine with the reference standard. </p>
<p>If the size of the part is <b>larger</b>, it can be sent to be fixed, and the detector prints the number 1.<br>If the
    size of the part is <b>smaller</b>, it is removed as a reject, and the detector prints the number -1.<br>If the part
    is <b>perfect</b>, it is sent to the box with products, that are ready to ship, and the detector prints 0.</p>
<p>Write a program, which takes the number of parts <b><i>n</i></b> as input, <span> and then the sequence of detector prints. The program should output numbers in a single line containing the number of parts ready to be shipped, the number of parts to be fixed, and the number of rejects.</span>
